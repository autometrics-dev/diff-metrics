// - the github.getOctokit constructor won't accept no auth, and
// - building a raw Octokit does not typecheck with download_am_list
//   (ref: https://github.com/actions/toolkit/issues/1419)
// This token has only public repos access, and no impersonation authorization.
// Github will still disable the token even though the risk is known and there's no workaround, so the test is deactivated
